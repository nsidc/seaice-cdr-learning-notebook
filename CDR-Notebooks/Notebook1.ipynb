    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the Sea Ice Concetration (SIC) Climate Data Record (CDR) Learning Notebooks. This set of tutorials consists of six Jupyter Notebooks. After the completion of all Notebooks, you will know what the SIC CDR is, what a STAC catalog is, and how to access the SIC CDR from the STAC catalog so that you can interact with the data to compute sea ice extent, create graphs and plots, and compare the SIC CDR with other sea ice data and surface air temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook (Notebook 1), you will learn about sea ice and the sea ice concentration CDR as well as the format and contents of the netCDF data files. You will also be presented with an outline of what to expect in the other five notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Sea Ice Concentration and Why is it Important?\n",
    "Sea ice concentration is the fraction of ocean area covered by sea ice, usually described as a percentage. The ocean can be covered by thick sheets of unbroken ice with 100% coverage (Figure 1, bottom), by no sea ice (0% concentration), or partially covered with any concentration between 0 and 100. An example of partial coverage is pancake ice (Figure 1, top). Pancake ice forms when the ocean is beginning to freeze, but the surface is rough and choppy. The waves break up the thin layer of ice on the water's surface, causing the pieces to bump into each other and round off their edges giving them their characteristic pancake shape. Sea ice concentration changes throughout the year reaching a minumum in the summer (September for the Arctic, February/March for the Antartic) and a maximum in the winter (March for the Arctic, September/October for the Antartic). Figure 2 shows graphs of the sea ice minmum for the Arctic and Antarctic in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding sea ice concentrations in the polar regions is critical to our understanding of the fitness of our planet in a warming world. The Arctic is like the canary in the coal mine for the health of Earth’s climate and is an early sign of the effects of climate change. The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe, and one indicator of the enormous amount of transformation occurring there is the loss of sea ice. Sea ice is one of the most rapidly changing areas of the Arctic environment. Its loss impacts not just the Arctic region but the entire planet because it plays a critical role in regulating Earth’s climate and influences global weather patterns and ocean circulations. Because Arctic sea ice is light in color, it reflects most of the sunlight that hits the sea ice surface. This prevents too much heat from being absorbed into the ocean and helps to keep the region cool. However, as more sea ice is lost, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, which causes more melting. This amplifies warming, and the cycle continues. There are also noticeable changes in Antarctic sea ice, especially since 2016, and some scientists speculate a regime shift is occurring there as well. For these reasons, it is imperative that we monitor changes in sea ice and share information about the changes that are occurring.\n",

    "## What is the SIC CDR?\n",
    "The [Version 4 NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record of Passive Microwave Sea Ice Concentration](https://nsidc.org/data/g02202/versions/4 \"Version 4 Climate Data Record of Sea Ice Concentration Web Page\") is a sea ice concentration data set that allows one to analyze and monitor the state of the sea ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic. This data set provides a Climate Data Record (CDR) of sea ice concentration (SIC) from passive microwave data. The CDR algorithm output is a rule-based combination of ice concentration estimates from two well-established algorithms: the NASA Team (NT) algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984) and NASA Bootstrap (BT) algorithm (Comiso 1986). The CDR is a consistent, daily and monthly time series of sea ice concentrations from 25 October 1978 through the most recent processing for both the north and south polar regions. All data are on a 25 km x 25 km grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Note: In the SIC CDR, a 10% concentration threshold is used to define valid ice – any grid cell with a concentration of less than 10% is set to 0% (i.e. open ocean). A 15% cutoff is a common standard that has been in use for many years (Zwally et al., 1983); and in comparisons with other satellite data, has agreed well, on an average basis, with the observed ice (Cavalieri et al., 1991; Meier et al., 2003). However, there are indications that the Bootstrap algorithm can potentially detect ice at as low as 8% levels (Comiso and Nishio, 2008). To be conservative, a 10% cutoff was operationally chosen for the CDR data fields. The validity of the assumption that ice concentrations greater than 10% and less than 15% are good data depends on the character of the ice edge as well as ocean and atmospheric conditions. We recommend that users deriving total extent and area calculations continue to use a 15% cutoff because low concentrations have much higher uncertainties. To allign with this recommendation, these notebooks will use the 15% threshold to define valid ice and will include code to further clip the data to this concentration.\n",

With completion of Notebook 5, the user will have learned how to plot and graph sea ice concentrations against other sea ice data sets to see how they compare to one another. Also, users will have learned how to plot and graph sea ice concentration against air temperature, sea surface temperature, and sea level pressure to see how those measurements compares/affect sea ice over time."
