# Sea Ice CDR Learning Notebooks

Welcome to the Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) Climate Data Record (CDR) Learning Notebooks. This set of tutorials consists of six Jupyter Notebooks. After the completion of all Notebooks, you will know what the SIC CDR is, what a STAC catalog is, and how to access the SIC CDR from the STAC catalog so that you can interact with the data to compute sea ice extent, create graphs and plots, and compare the SIC CDR with other sea ice data and surface air temperature.
